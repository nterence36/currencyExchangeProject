CURRENCY CONVERSION APP.
Designing an application that utilizes a currency exchange rate API to allow users to view exchange rates/conversion. Below, I'll outline the key components and steps to design such an application:

1. Define the Application's Purpose:

 This application is to view currency conversion. Where user is able to enter the amount he or she wants to convert, pick a currency he/she has and then the currency he/she intend to convert to from a dropdown list of currency. It uses an API that sort or fetch for these currencies. I use the Forex 7 days free trial for this project but plan to get a free API that can be run at anytime

3. User Interface (UI) Design:

This application has a user friendly setup. There is currency selection dropdwon where user can pick or select the base currency and traget currency to convert to. There is also an input section where user can enter the amount they want to convert and finanly there is a submit button that when selected do the calculation for the user and display the final result.

4. Application Development:

    This application is design using REACT

Future Work:
- Use different states to eliminate the issue of trial version such that i only take an API url that gives me all the currency and then use the resulty to build tha application.
- Include exchange rate icon or value in the display.
